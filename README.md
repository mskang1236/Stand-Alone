# Stand-Alone
Group project for 2021-2 Media Arts Studio.

The group consisted of 4 people:
  -2 game programmers
  -1 scenario writer
  -1 UI designer (+3D modeling)

I was one of the programmers, and wrote scripts regarding interactions of player and certain items that are key to winning the game.
Since I was'nt the only programmer, I only uploaded scripts that I wrote, so this repository might not be complete.
